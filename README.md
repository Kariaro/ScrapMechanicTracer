# ScrapMechanicTracer

This script was made for ghidra.....


This script will scan ScrapMechanic and return a file that lists all the function arguments and call locations..

The idea of this script is to make it easier for modders to create new mods for ScrapMechanic.
This should work on any version of Scrap Mechanic.
